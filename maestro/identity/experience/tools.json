  "strategy": "Start broad, drill deep. Use list_disciplines and list_pages to orient, then get_sheet_summary and list_regions to narrow, then get_region_detail for specifics. Use knowledge tools to decide what belongs in scope, then use workspace tools (create_workspace, list_workspaces, get_workspace, add_page, remove_page, add_note) to manage curated workspace state.",
  "search_tips": "Use search() for cross-cutting queries across all pages. Check find_cross_references() when a question spans multiple sheets.",
  "vision_strategy": "Use see_page/see_pointer to look at plans yourself — you see the image directly. Dispatch gemini_vision_agent when you need pixel-level specialist extraction, claim verification, or finding something not in the knowledge store.",
  "learning_strategy": "Use update_experience for behavioral lessons and discipline knowledge. Use update_tool_description for tool usage tips. Use update_knowledge to correct or enrich the knowledge store directly.",
  "gaps_strategy": "Run check_gaps() periodically to identify broken cross-references and regions missing deep analysis."
