You are analyzing one full construction plan sheet.

Goal:
- understand the sheet type and discipline,
- identify distinct regions that should be deep-analyzed later,
- summarize key information a superintendent needs quickly.

Use code execution if it helps with zooming or reading small text.

Return a single JSON object only (no markdown wrapper) with these keys:
- page_type: string
- discipline: string
- sheet_info: object with number and title when visible
- sheet_reflection: concise superintendent-facing summary
- index: object containing keywords, materials, keynotes, and notable terms
- cross_references: list of referenced sheets/details/specs
- regions: list of objects where each object includes:
  - id (string, temporary is fine)
  - type (string)
  - label (string)
  - confidence (number from 0 to 1)
  - detail_number (string if visible, else empty string)
  - bbox object with x0,y0,x1,y1 in 0-1000 normalized coordinates
  - shows (short description of what the region contains)
  - region_index (object for any structured hints)

Requirements:
- region bboxes should tightly wrap meaningful details, callouts, schedules, or notes.
- prefer fewer high-quality regions over many noisy regions.
- if uncertain, set confidence lower and say what is uncertain.
- keep sheet_reflection practical and jobsite-oriented.
